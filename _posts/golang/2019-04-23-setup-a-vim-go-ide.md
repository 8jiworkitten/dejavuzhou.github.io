I like to claim I'm a vi person. The time I've spent to learn how to work with this little beast is one of the best ROI decisions I've made as a programmer. But every now and then, people say "Well, how the *hell* do you work with such an archaic setup??! you're missing on 30 years of IDE advancements, get on with the times!!!".

Personally I like to keep my `vi/vim` setup nice and minimal like it's 1999, and don't really use plugins. When you're hopping between servers all day long, it's the *sane* thing to do.

But here's something I wanted to show you. How to use vim as a fully-fledged IDE for developing in Golang and keep your lighting fast workflow, without missing out on *any* niceties.

First things first, here's how the result looks. I promise, this is not one of these "unix-porn", fantastical but unusable setups you see on the internet. It is something you can work in on a daily basis, and something that *you* can set up in less than 30 minutes.

### Convinced? Let's go! 

There are four basic components I'm using here, you can add/modify/remove as you see fit. Each one of these is a separate deep subject of its own, but I'll stick to the very basics, just so you can get productive ASAP. 

These are

- [vim-go](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go) for all your Go needs
- [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree) as a handy file explorer
- [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) for eye candy. 
- [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git) as a seriously awesome git wrapper


Let's check them out!

## Quick Note
For reference, I'll be using Vim 8.1. Vim8 added native [support](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it) for packages. 

Vim has an expanding, awesome plugin ecosystem, but it can be complicated for beginners, as it's dominated by third-party package tools, which include Pathogen, Vundle, vim-plug and what have you.

Vim 8 means that you can load plugins by just copy/pasting their contents into your `~/.vim` directory! Installing and removing them is just a `git clone` and `rm -r` away, and updating them is just an issue of `git pull`ing the latest releases! Thanks [Bran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bram_Moolenaar)! You can learn more about this awesome new feature using `:h packages`. 

After finishing up the installations of your chosen plugins make sure to run `:helptags ALL` to automatically generate help tags for each one of them.



## vim-go

The magic sauce of the setup is `vim-go`.

As I mentioned, I don't particularly care about vim plugins and mostly use it vanilla, but if I'm working with Go, I make an exception for this one.

It does almost everything your IDE supports, but pre-baked into your vim workflow!

- Compile/Run/Install your Go project
- Run `gofmt` and `goimports` on save.
- Jump to symbols or functions definitions
- Automatic variable type and function signature info
- Peek at documentation
- Run your test suite whole, or in parts
- Autocomplete
- Checking coverage
- Managing Imports
- Refactor safely
- Code Linting

In many cases, the commands might open up a *"quickfix window"* as to raise errors, quickly provide definitions, or report on test results. You can use `Ctrl-WW` or `Ctrl-W + ArrowKey` to cycle between your code and this extra window.


### Installing / Removing vim-go

The easiest way to install `vim-go` if you're using Vim >=8, is to directly clone the repo on your home directory, like   
`git clone https://github.com/fatih/vim-go.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go`   

To remove the `vim-go` plugin, you can just   
`rm -r ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go`    
and you're all set!

To enable it, you only need to add `filetype plugin indent on` to your `~/.vimrc`. I suggest you also add `set backspace=indent,eol,start` in another line, just in case your backspace returns to *old-school/hardcore* vim mode, so it keeps working like for most other people.

After installing and enabling the plugin, open up vim and run `:GoInstallBinaries` so that the tool checks `$GOPATH` and `go get`s required binaries for `godoc`, `gopls` etc.

### Using vim-go.
Without further ado, here's a handy reference table of how to achieve all this and more! 
It's pretty useful as a cheatsheet for the first times you'll be using your new "IDE".


### Cheatsheet
```
:GoRun :GoBuild :GoInstall   

:GoDef          # goto definition of object under cursor   
gd              # also has the same effect
Ctrl-O / Ctrl-I # hop back to your source file/return to definition

:GoDoc          # opens up a side window for quick documentationn   
K               # also has the same effect

   
:GoTest         # run every *_test.go file and report results   
:GoTestFunc     # or just test the function under your cursor   
:GoCoverage     # check your test coverage   
:GoAlternate	# switch bewteen your test case and implementation   

:GoImport       # manage and name your imports   
:GoImportAs   
:GoDrop   
   
:GoRename       # precise renaming of identifiers   
   
:GoLint         # lint your code   
:GoVer   
:GoErrCheck   
   
:GoAddTags      # manage your tags   
:GoRemoveTags   
```

I've personally added the following two directives on my .vimrc, as they've proved really useful.
```vim
let g:go_fmt_command = "goimports"    # Run goimports along gofmt on each save     
let g:go_auto_type_info = 1           # Automatically get signature/type info for object under cursor     
```

### Autocomplete
Completion is enabled by default via *omnifunc*, and supported by the `gocode` and `gopls` utilities. When you're in INSERT mode, you may trigger it using `Ctrl-X Ctrl-O`.

To check if vim-go's `ftplugin/go.vim` has been configured correctly for autocompletion, you can run the following command. The message below should appear
```vim
:verbose setlocal omnifunc?
omnifunc=go#complete#Complete
        Last set from ~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/vim-go/ftplugin/go.vim
```

If you want the autocomplete prompt to appear automatically whenever you press the dot (`.`), you can add the following line to your `~/.vimrc`, but I personally don't like to clutter the UI, and only call it whenever needed.
```vim
au filetype go inoremap <buffer> . .<C-x><C-o>
```

### Documentation 
The complete documentation is available on the [repo](https://github.com/fatih/vim-go/blob/master/doc/vim-go.txt), and also right there on your editor, accessible by `:help vim-go`. There are various other shortcuts and utilities you can put to use, so make sure to check it out.




## NERDTree
Most of fancy-vim guides out there will be suggesting you try [NERDTree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree), and they have a point.

NERDTree is a fully fledged file system explorer, which helps to visually browse your OS using a tree-style "side window". 

It allows you to quickly open files, edit directory structures, copy/rename/delete files and folders and everything you'd naturally expect from such a tool.

### Installing / Removing NERDTree

Again, if you're using Vim >=8, you can just clone the repo    
`git clone https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree.git ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/nerdtree`    
and start using NERDTree.

Of course, to remove it just   
`rm -r ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/nerdtree`

### Using NERDTree
The only command you need for NERDTree to help in your day-to-day workflow is  `:NERDTreeToggle`, to open and close the side file explorer. Switch between your code and NERDTree window using `Ctrl-WW` (double W) or `Ctrl-W + ArrowKey`.

You can define a shortcut like `Ctrl-G` (or some other one) to get NERDTree out of the way or into focus by adding something like this in your `~/.vimrc` 
```vim
" NERDTree plugin specific commands
:nnoremap <C-g> :NERDTreeToggle<CR>
```
### Above and Beyond
There's decent documentation built-in NERDTree, by pressing `?`, but even the *dead simplest* case of navigating using your arrow keys and pressing Enter to open files is a huge timesaver.

You could also use [netrw](https://shapeshed.com/vim-netrw/) as an alternative, as it has grown to be an awesome tool as well.


## vim-airline

vim-airline is a pretty and lightweight status bar for vim. It provides not only eye candy, but also at-a-glance information such as file encoding, file type, Git status, permissions, your current position in the file, and more.

Many people love [getting](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/4a4b1j/vim_porn_2_post_your_vim_screenshots/) [creative](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1mzefb/what_does_your_statusline_look_like/) with their status line. You can even start [your own](https://hackernoon.com/the-last-statusline-for-vim-a613048959b2). On the other hand, vim-airline takes all the fuss away and provides with sensible, pretty defaults and access to a nice modding community.

Most common questions can be answered by their [great FAQ page](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline/wiki/FAQ). 

### Installing / Removing vim-airline
If you're running Vim >= 8, you can install it by running   
`git clone https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/vim-airline`. 

When you want to remove it, or freshen up with something more personal, it's just an    
`rm -r ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/vim-airline`   


### Using vim-airline
Here's how it looks like in action, in various statuses and files on my system.

If you have any issues with missing symbols or fonts not rendering correctly, you should first check that your terminal supports UTF-8. 

If the issue persists, the next step would be to download a custom font that contains the additional symbols you need (such as [this one](https://github.com/runsisi/consolas-font-for-powerline) for Consolas), and/or add `let g:airline_powerline_fonts = 1` to your `~/.vimrc` and your issues should be resolved!

## vim-fugitive

Well, one final little thing, the cherry on top. To get that sweet information about your version control system, you need [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive). 

<center>
<img src="/assets/image//vim-fugitive.png" style='height: 50%; width: 50%; object-fit: contain'/>
</center>

[Tim Pope](http://twitter.com/tpope) is *the* vim plugin guy. He's the original creator of the most popular third-party package management, Pathogen, as well as the author of many of the top `vim` plugins.

Anyway, Tim says about his work : "*fugitive.vim: A Git wrapper so awesome, it should be illegal*". And he's mostly right.

### Installing / Removing vim-fugitive
To install you can just   
`git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive.git ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/vim-fugitive`    
and if it doesn't suit you, just remove it with     
`rm -r ~/.vim/pack/dist/start/vim-fugitive`


### Using vim-fugitive
Without learning any commands, `vim-fugitive` simply provides instant info about the state of your repo, and helps keep track of where you're working on. But also, it is a very deep plugin, an excellent and powerful complement to the command line git. 

You can get started with just three basic commands, and use `git` without opening and closing your files all the time:
```
:Gstatus        # run `git status`
:Gdiff          # diff the working tree vs staged version
:Gcommit %      # commit the current file
```

The next step would be to check the [documentation](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive/blob/master/doc/fugitive.txt) for more!


You can take a look at my personal `~/.vimrc` setup, if you want to copy some ideas.

## .vimrc 

Here's  my `~/.vimrc` in case you want to steal any ideas.

```vim

" sw - when indenting with '>', use 4 spaces width
" sts - control <tab> and <bs> keys to match tabstop

endif

let g:airline_symbols.linenr = '␊'
let g:airline_symbols.linenr = '␤'
let g:airline_symbols.linenr = '¶'
let g:airline_symbols.branch = '⎇'

let g:airline_symbols.paste = '∥'
let g:airline_symbols.whitespace = 'Ξ'

let g:airline_right_alt_sep = ''
let g:airline_symbols.branch = ''
let g:airline_symbols.readonly = ''
let g:airline_symbols.linenr = ''

```



## Startup Time

Someone will argue "You're using `vi` for performance, all these plugin slow things down. Don't be stubborn, just use a god-damned IDE".

They may have a point in trying some other IDE, not so sure about vim slowing down though!

You can use `vim --startuptime startup.log` to start vim. It will list every action taken until the point where it becomes interactive for you to use, and save results on a `startup.log` file. The times reported there are in Milliseconds.

I tested for 20 'starts' of vi, when the values should start to look like a normal distribution. It's as easy as
```bash
for i in {1..20}; do 
    vim --startuptime start$i.log; 
done

find start* -exec grep STARTED {} \; | cut -d' ' -f1
```

The major cause of delay seemed to be the automatic opening of NERDTree. In general, the full-blown setup **never** takes more than 300ms to open, which is *way* faster than most (if not all) Desktop applications you might have tested against.

I tested the following cases, and present the results in a table below. 

- Windows 10 WSL "nude" Vim (no plugins, empty .vimrc)
- CentOS 7 Virtualbox VM "nude" Vim
- Centos 7 Idle Server "nude" Vim
- Windows 10 WSL w/ Automatic startup of NERDTree disabled
- Windows 10 WSL w/ Full Plugins (hot start)
- Windows 10 WSL w/ Full Plugins (cold start)
- Windows 10 WSL w/ Full Plugins (inside Git repo)


```
| System                    | Median | Average | Worst  |
|---------------------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Win10 WSL "nude" vim      |  23.25 | 23.50   |  27    |
| CentOS 7 VM "nude" vim    |  33.82 | 33.83   |  36    |
| CentOS 7 Native "nude" vim|  46.49 | 49.09   |  61    | 
| Win10 WSL No Auto NERDTree| 108.06 | 107.85  | 112    | 
| Win10 WSL Full vim (hot)  | 194.08 | 193.64  | 254    |
| Win10 WSL Full vim (cold) | 230.61 | 231.03  | 254    |
| Win10 WSL Full vim (repo) | 252.38 | 250.99  | 276    |
```

Not bad at all!

### Parting words
I hope you have enjoyed this post as much as I did creating it! Feel free to share and discuss, send me an email or a Twitter DM for any suggestions, insights or corrections.

If you indeed decide to use this setup exlusively, you *might* need an afternoon or so of tinkering, but it's up to you to decide if it's worth your time. For me, personally, it's both fun and provides immense utility, make of that what you will.

Finally, if you want to try some more advanced stuff, feel free to check out [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale) as an "ascynchronous lint engine" to provide on-the-fly syntax checking, warnings about semantic erros and other goodies, [vim-delve](https://github.com/sebdah/vim-delve) to tie delve support into vim for debugging your Go application as well as any of the numerous plugins that provide snippet support.

Until next time!
